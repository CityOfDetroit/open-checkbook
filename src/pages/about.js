            <p>  
              Open Checkbook allows users to view the amount and category of City payments on a variety of dimensions. Users can navigate City payment data using various charts and graphs to see how dollars from various funding sources are being spent.

            <p>
              Open Checkbook allows users to view payment data by Fund, Department, Division, Unit, Payment Category, and Payment Class. Because of the large number of individual values in certain cases, we have grouped the information for ease of reference. Grouped information can be expanded to view the underlying detail. Encumbrances are not included in this Open Payments Data tool.
